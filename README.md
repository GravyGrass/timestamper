A high resolution timestamp display for OBS browser source, inspired by
[this post](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/time-and-or-date-overlay-solved.753/).

It has more features like:

*   Millisecond level accuracy
*   Timer updates are synchronized with OBS frame rate
*   A useless frame counter
